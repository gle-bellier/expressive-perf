# Performance Modelling With GANs



Implementation of GANs for performance modelling. The different models aim at  converting MIDI files into expressive contours of fundamental frequency $f_0$ and loudness provided to the *DDSP* model. (https://magenta.tensorflow.org/ddsp). This last restitute the timber of a monophonic instrument and outputs the waveform corresponding to the input contours. The main idea is to generate expressive performance contours without a time-aligned dataset of musical performances and there corresponding symbolic representation (MIDI files). 
## Project structure

All models and their blocks are located in the `src/perf_gan/models` folder and the corresponding losses in the `src/perf_gan/losses`.

Run tests with *pytest* from `test/`. All data files will be written to the `data/` folder and synthetic dataset generators are located in `src/perf_gan/data`.
